Move* to a specified active development path via pushd.
  * actually generates shell commands to do such

Usage:  dev [options] <pattern>
        dev [options] append <path>
        dev [options] insert <path>
        dev [options] set <pattern> <path>
        dev [options] delete <pattern>

Move, via pushd, to the first development path matching <pattern>.

Alternatively, if an action is specified, perform it instead.

DEV_PATHS is typically '~/.dev-paths' but this may be controlled
by setting DEV_PATHS to an alternate file name.

Management Actions :
  append        Append <path> to the end of DEV_PATHS.
  insert        Insert <path> at the start of DEV_PATHS.
  set           Replace first path matching <pattern> with
                <path> or report error if not found.

Options :
  -h, --help    Show this usage message.
  --version     Show version and exit.

Future :
  -N            Go to the Nth matching path.
